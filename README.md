Lumina – Smart Home Automation UX App

## 📱 Overview
**Lumina** is a smart home app prototype focused on **real-world usability**, **trust-building**, and **seamless interaction** across a wide range of user types. Designed in **Figma**, Lumina addresses modern needs in home automation with an emphasis on accessibility, personalization, and intuitive design.

This project was developed by a team of five as part of a user-centered design challenge.


## 🎯 Project Objective
- Design an app that simplifies home security for diverse users.
- Prioritize user trust, accessibility, and emotional satisfaction.
- Build an interactive prototype that supports core tasks like creating and verifying security checklists.


## 👥 User-Centered Approach

We created **five distinct personas** to guide our design choices:
- **Asha** – a retired woman with minimal tech exposure.
- **Ayush** – a tech-savvy working professional.
- **Maria** – a busy parent focused on safety.
- **Malhotra** – a businessman frequently traveling.
- **Oliver** – a student living independently for the first time.

These personas helped us align the app with real user needs, abilities, and goals.
